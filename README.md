<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    This repository serves as a centralized hub for our CS internship technical
    sessions. Here, you'll find a record of topics covered, discussions held,
    and code snippets shared during sessions.

<h2>Branch Naming Convention</h2>
<p>
    After each technical session, if there's a need to showcase code to the
    participants, it will be added to a branch with the respective date. You can
    easily locate and review the code discussed on that specific day by browsing
    through the branch list.
</p>
